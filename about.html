            <p>I am Chirag Chavda, a highly motivated student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) from DAIICT at Gandhinagar in Gujarat. With a strong focus on technology and innovation, I have developed a deep understanding of key skills and concepts related to ICT, and have a particular talent for problem-solving. As a proficient programmer with a strong command of C++ and expertise in data structures and algorithms (DSA), I have completed relevant courses and projects in this area, and have demonstrated a strong aptitude for key concepts and skills.
            </p>
             <p> I am also proud to be an alumnus of JNV Jamnagar, where I received a strong foundation in education and developed a strong work ethic. I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to give back to my community and help others achieve their goals. In my free time, I enjoy exploring my interests in physics and expressing my creativity through drawing.
